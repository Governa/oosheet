==========
OO, Sheet!
==========

OOSheet is a Python module for manipulating OpenOffice.org spreadsheet documents and creating macros.

Using Python, you interact with an OpenOffice.org instance to develop and test your code. When you're finished you can insert your python script inside the document to run it as macro, if this is what you desire.

OOSheet API was inspired by `JQuery <http://jquery.com/>`_. It uses selectors in same way that you would use in OpenOffice.org, with cascading method calls for quick development.
